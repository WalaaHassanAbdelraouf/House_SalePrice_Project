## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a crucial aspect of the real estate market, aiding buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions. In this project, we developed machine learning models to predict house sale prices based on various features such as the total living area, number of bathrooms, house age, and many others.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition "[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)". The dataset contains numerous features related to the properties, such as:

- SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable that you're trying to predict.

- MSSubClass: The building class

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps included:

1. Handling Missing Values: Missing values were handled by imputing to ensure that the dataset was clean and suitable for modeling.
2. Feature Engineering: Additional features were created to improve the model's predictive power such as:
    - OverallScore: An overall score calculated based on various quality and condition metrics.
    - TotalLivingArea: The total living area of the house.
    - TotalBath: The total number of bathrooms.
    - TotalBsmtFinSF: Total basement finished square feet.
    - HouseAge: The age of the house.
    - GarageYrBlt: The year the garage was built.
    - TotalSqft: Total square footage of the house.
    - TotalOutdoorArea: Total outdoor area of the property.
4. Encoding Categorical Features: Target encoding and ordinal encoding methods were applied to convert categorical variables into a numerical format.

## Feature Engineering

We applied polynomial feature transformation on selected features to capture non-linear relationships. The selected features for polynomial transformation included:

- `OverallScore`, `TotalLivingArea`, `TotalBath`, `TotalBsmtFinSF`, `HouseAge`, `OverallGarageQual`, `PavedStreet`, `RemodAge`, `GarageYrBlt`, `TotalSqft`, `TotalOutdoorArea`.

## Modeling

We used three different machine learning models to predict the house prices:

1. Lasso Regression: Used to perform both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy.
2. Decision Tree: A tree-based model to capture complex non-linear relationships.
3. Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction robustness.

### Model Training and Evaluation

Each model was trained on the training set and evaluated using the R-squared (RÂ²) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics for both training and testing sets.

## Results
